# The Digital Challenge at DELWP and how we plan to tackle the challenge.

###Wildlife App

This project is designed to assist Victoria's volunteer wildlife rehabilitators and institutes. We are doing this by building an app to educate on local wildlife and to inform the communicty on emergency contacts and procedures when dealing with wildlife. This allows users to interact via their mobile and also reduces strain on local wildlife centres by reducing calls to incorrect sources.


#### Technical Details

The project presents an app avialable for free download. 

###Fire App
