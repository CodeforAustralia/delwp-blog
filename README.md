##Wildlife Incidences and Emergencies 

http://codeforaustralia/delwp-blog/Wildlife-Incidences-and-emergencies.md

This project is designed to assist Victoria's volunteer wildlife rehabilitators and institutes, DELWP regional staff and general users. We are doing this by building awebsite to educate on local wildlife and to inform the communicty on emergency contacts and procedures when dealing with wildlife. This allows users to interact via their mobile and also reduces strain on local wildlife centres by reducing calls to incorrect sources through education.


#### Technical Details

The website will be hosted as a side site unders DELWP. 



##Planned Burns Map
